# Redi-project

This project combines three concepts -
1. Filtering tweets from Twitter API based on keywords. The tweets are filtered based on Author_id and tweet text.
2. Uploading the tweets filtered to googlesheets creating a repository which can be used in future for data analysis purposes.
3. Displaying the filtered tweets using a UI library tkinter on screen
